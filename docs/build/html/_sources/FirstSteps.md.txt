## Data Wrangling and Data Validation  -  tiger team

We are gathered here to build easy to use automated tools to wrangle data in the cloud
and provide tools for model output validation and evaluation.
Those tools include functionality such as 
- Sampling of pixel(s) to a table format
- Zonal Statistics of a polygon (county, watershed, land cover, etc.)
